## Installing

I'm hosting this Flatpak on my own Flatpak Repo. You can install it from there like this:

```bash
flatpak install https://flatpak.nils.moe/repo/appstream/net.sourceforge.gMKVExtractGUI.flatpakref
```

You also need to install the mono6 extension for gMKVExtractGUI to work:

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.mono6//24.08
```

## Building

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.mono6//24.08
flatpak-builder --install-deps-from=flathub --force-clean build-dir net.sourceforge.gMKVExtractGUI.yml
```
